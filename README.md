## 🛠️ Process
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates & irrelevant IDs.  
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., “M/F” → Male/Female).  
   - Grouped ages into categories (e.g., 0–30, 31–50, 51+).  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Pivot Tables created to analyze bike purchases by:  
     - Gender  
     - Age bracket  
     - Income range  
     - Commute distance  
     - Region  

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built in Excel using:  
     - Pivot Tables + Pivot Charts  
     - Slicers (for filtering by gender, marital status, region)  
     - Interactive visuals for quick insights
