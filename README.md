## Dataset
- **Source:** Provided practice dataset (“bike_buyers” sheet).  
- **Size:** 1,026 rows × 13 columns.  
- **Features:**  
  - Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Region  
  - Socioeconomic: Income, Occupation, Cars, Home Ownership  
  - Lifestyle: Commute Distance, Children  
  - Target Variable: **Purchased Bike (Yes/No)**  
- **Data Quality:** No missing values, clean dataset ready for analysis.

## Tool
- Microsoft Excel
 
## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates & irrelevant IDs.  
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., “M/F” → Male/Female).  
   - Grouped ages into categories (e.g., 0–30, 31–50, 51+).  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Pivot Tables created to analyze bike purchases by:  
     - Gender  
     - Age bracket  
     - Income range  
     - Commute distance  
     - Region  

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built in Excel using:  
     - Pivot Tables + Pivot Charts  
     - Slicers (for filtering by gender, marital status, region)  
     - Interactive visuals for quick insights
